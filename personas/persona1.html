            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <div>
                Iuliana Dobrică, born on September 20, 1992, is a fitness trainer, and graduate of the Faculty of Sports
                and Physical
                Education, currently residing in Iași, Romania.
                <br><br>
                She is a joyful person who leads an active lifestyle and really enjoys her job. Iuliana's top priority
                is health and good nutrition, and that translates across her closest companion, Luna, the golden
                retriever. They have a very close bond together, and Iuliana is committed to providing Luna with the
                best possible care and training.
                <br><br>
                Iuliana's practical goals include teaching Luna new commands and closely monitoring her progress. She is
                careful about Luna's nutrition and maintains regular contact with veterinarians, in order to stay
                informed about Luna's health.
                <br><br>
                In addition to this, Iuliana aspires to strengthen the relationship between herself and Luna. She finds
                fulfillment in providing Luna with the best care and training. Moreover, she seeks support and
                encouragement from other dog owners, since Iuliana is a very social person and loves being part of a
                community.
                <br><br>
                Iuliana has always faced some issues relating her quest for optimal pet care. She is disappointed by the
                limited and outdated content and resources available online. Furthermore, she is wary of the abundance
                of misinformation in the dog care space and seeks only accurate guidance from professionals.
                <br><br>
                In conclusion, Iuliana needs the optimal tool that caters to all her needs: a tool which is
                well-organized, customizable, trust-worthy and community-based.

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Iuliana starts her day by taking Luna for a morning walk and training session at the local park. She
                uses GUD BOI's training feature, in order to teach Luna the command “Sit”. She follows the steps
                provided by the application: she records the dog while receiving feedback from the smart assistant.
                Iuliana repeats the process several times, until the dog obeys the command. <b>End point:</b> the dog
                learns to associate the word “Sit” with the action of sitting down. Iuliana feels satisfied of Luna's
                progress, which strengthens their bond, and their communication as trainer and dog. New, more difficult
                commands are unlocked for Iuliana.</li><br>
            <li>Iuliana receives a notification from GUD BOI, which reminds her of Luna's annual vaccinations. Iuliana
                opens the application, which redirects her to a phone call with the veterinary clinic, and she schedules
                the vet appointment. <b>End point:</b> Iuliana feels happy with her abilities as a dog owner, since she
                didn't have to remember the annual vaccination.</li><br>
            <li>During a training session, Iuliana faces difficulty teaching Luna a new trick. She is unable to find a
                solution, so she turns to the community chat. Within a couple of minutes, she receives helpful advice
                and tips from the community. <b>End point:</b> the training session is succesful. Iuliana's bond with
                Luna grows even more, and she is glad she can rely on the dog enthusiast community.
