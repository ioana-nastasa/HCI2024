            <h3>Detailed Description</h3>
            <div>
                Vasile is a retired math teacher from Bucharest, who leads a simple, quiet life along with his wife and their senior dog, Bobiță. He has owned Bobiță ever since it was a puppy, and since then, the dog has been the most important thing in Vasile's life.
                <br><br>
                Vasile wishes to keep Bobiță's mental agility and overall health in the best shape. Despite being a very meticulous man, he is guilty of being a little forgetful and clumsy about some of his dog's needs, such as medication time, or remembering vet appointments.
                <br><br>
                Vasile wants to focus on simple activities that strengthen his connection with his best friend. He prioritizes quality time together over tiresome training sessions. Above all, Vasile is dedicated to ensuring that Bobiță's final years are filled with love, comfort, and happiness, making each day together special and meaningful.
                <br><br>
                Finally, Vasile values simplicity and organization. He needs a simple, easy-to-use tool that adapts to his visual impairments issues, since he has been wearing glasses for his poor sight most of his lifetime.

        <h3>Scenarios</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Vasile takes Bobiță for their daily walk in the park. He uses GUD BOI's simplified training feature to reinforce Bobiță's existing commands, like "Sit" and "Stay". Following the step-by-step instructions, Vasile guides Bobiță through the exercises, feeling proud as Bobiță obediently follows. <b>End point:</b> the dog responds well to the commands, strengthening their bond and making their walks more enjoyable.</li><br>
            <li>Vasile and Bobiță go on a calming walk through the local park, accompanied by a friend from the neighborhood. As they walk, Vasile uses GUD BOI's "Map My Walk" feature to track their route and distance. <b>End point:</b> Vasile feels accomplished as he monitors their activity levels and enjoys the company of his friend and faithful dog.</li><br>
            <li>During a family gathering at Vasile's home, Bobiță becomes anxious and restless in the agitated environment. Sensing his dog's discomfort, Vasile accesses GUD BOI's library of calming music and plays soothing melodies for Bobiță. <b>End point:</b> Bobiță relaxes in the comforting soundscape, and Vasile feels relieved as his beloved pet finds peace.
